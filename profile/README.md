## What is DMG Canvas?  

**DMG Canvas** is a specialized **disk image creation and design utility** used by developers and software publishers to craft polished, branded DMG installers. It provides a visual interface for building professional macOS disk images with custom backgrounds, layouts, and licensing features.  

Rather than manually configuring DMG files in Terminal or using scripts, DMG Canvas simplifies the process with **drag-and-drop layout editing**, **live previews**, and **automatic code signing** support. You can create elegant installation experiences that reflect your brand identity while maintaining full compatibility with macOS standards.  

The application enables you to include **license agreements**, **read-me files**, and **application icons** directly within the DMG. You can also define automatic mounting positions, background artwork, and custom window sizes, giving your installer a unique, professional finish.  

Designed for developers and designers alike, DMG Canvas is optimized for **Apple Silicon** and integrates seamlessly with modern build pipelines, making it a must-have tool for packaging and distributing macOS software efficiently and beautifully.
